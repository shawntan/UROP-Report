\chapter{Evaluation}

For the evaluation of this part of the system, a group of 30 students were paid to do a simple 30 minute evaluation of the system. A simple tutorial was given to each of the students, and once completed, a simple extraction task from the bookdepository.co.uk website was to be carried out. Lastly, the students were asked to fill out a questionnaire on the following aspects of the system: Ease of installation of the bookmarklet, the ease of item selection, and the ease with which they could view the extracted items.
