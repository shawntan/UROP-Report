\begin{abstract}
In this report, I present an algorithm providing an iterative method for users to generate a 
wrapper visually from a given web page, and also a machine learning solution for extraction of
data after a site layout change. These were implemented as a system, and then evaluated 
both quantitatively and qualitatively.

	I would like to extend my gratitude to my supervisor, A/P Kan Min-Yen, for his patience
when explaining certain concepts to me, and guidance throughout the project. I am grateful
for this opportunity to work on this UROP project under his care. I would also like to thank
the entire WING group, for their valuable advice, especially Jesse Prabawa, for answering 
so many of my questions.

\chapter{Introduction}
Many problems exist in computer science.  In this project, we 
studied one particular important problem and propose a solution 
for it.  

\section{Background}
In this section, we briefly discuss the history and background
of the problem.  A detail literature survey is presented in 
Chapter \ref{ch:related}.

The problem we study in this report is an important one.
This problem is first proposed in 1990 in the context
of graph theory \cite{smith90graph}.  Zhang gives the
first algorithm to the problem and applied it to solve several 
problems in artificial intelligence \cite{zhang91ai,zhang92ai}.  
More recently, a slightly different formulation of the problem
is studied independently \cite{kovsky92diff,ali94diff}.  None of this previous work
uses the technique that we propose in this project.  Thus, we 
believe that our algorithm is novel.

\section{The Problem}
In this section, we formally defined the problem.  We adopt
the definition given by Kovsky \cite{kovsky92diff}.

\chapter{Proofs}
In this appendix, we present alternate, longer, but more interesting proof 
of correctness of our algorithm.  This proof is based on induction and proof
by contradiction.
