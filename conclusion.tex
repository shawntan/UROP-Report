\chapter{Conclusion}
The current approach does not solve the issue of unordered elements that are extracted from the pages. While some methods have been devised, none of them have been implemented and tested at this time.

More importantly, in the following semester, more fine tuning of the machine learning component needs to be done. Also, formal evaluation of the methods described has to be carried out.
