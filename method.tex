In the following sections, we will elaborate on the contributions of this report.
In the first section we will describe traversal path alignment algorithm, which we
propose to overcome the issues of current methods of XPath generation by providing
a way to create viable XPaths based on elements that users have selected or rejected,
giving them a visual understanding of what will be extracted as they complete the process.

Next, we address the approach we take in trying to create a robust wrapper for the site.
We propose a framework for learning models for classification of HTML tags or DOM nodes by
learning from extracted instances using the XPath.
