\begin{abstract}
In this report, I present an algorithm providing an iterative method for users to generate a 
wrapper visually from a given web page, and also a machine learning solution for extraction of
data after a site layout change. These were implemented as a system, and then evaluated 
both quantitatively and qualitatively.

\begin{acknowledgement}
	I would like to extend my gratitude to my supervisor, A/P Kan Min-Yen, for his patience
when explaining certain concepts to me, and guidance throughout the project. I am grateful
for this opportunity to work on this UROP project under his care. I would also like to thank
the entire WING group, for their valuable advice, especially Jesse Prabawa, for answering 
so many of my questions.

\chapter{Proofs}
In this appendix, we present alternate, longer, but more interesting proof 
of correctness of our algorithm.  This proof is based on induction and proof
by contradiction.
