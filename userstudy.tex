\subsection{Evaluator demographics}
We conducted a survey with these 30 students before they interacted with our system,
and asked them about their prior experiences with Web IE.

60\% of the students have never heard of Web IE. In order to keep up
to date with topics they are interested in, a little over 60\% manually visit the
sites of such topics, while 22\% make use of RSS feeds. When asked if they knew 
what a screen-scraper or a wrapper was, only 1 out of the 30 have heard of them,
and 96\% have never used any form of Web IE tool before.

This suggests that while companies have the capabilities and resources to harness
the power of data mining and Web IE, many users, even those as tech savvy as 
university students, are either unaware of such technology, or such tools are
not as accessible to users.

When asked how they would go about getting specific data from a set of pages 
into a tabular form for some research or personal interest, many of them said
they would approach the problem manually, copying and pasting the required data
into a spreadsheet or a text file.
